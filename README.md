# High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) 
HEIF is a visual media container format standardized by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) for storage and sharing of images and image sequences. It is based on the well-known ISO Base Media File Format (ISOBMFF) standard. HEIF Reader/Writer Engine is an implementation of HEIF standard in order to demonstrate its powerful features and capabilities.

## Features:
HEIF is a media container format. It is not an image or video encoder per se. Hence, the quality of the visual media depends highly on the proper usage of visual media encoder (e.g. HEVC). Current standard allows containing High Efficiency Video Codec (HEVC, H.265) encoded bitstreams. This can be easily extended to future visual media codecs. It has many powerful features which are currently not present in other image file formats. Some of these features are:
* Media data is encoded according to the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard.
* Storage based on widely adopted ISO Base Media File Format (ISOBMFF)
* Supports efficient storage of image bursts and cinemagraphs 
* Supports computational photography use cases
* Supports both lossy and lossless image data storage
* A better and easy way to distribute still images, image collections and related metadata.
